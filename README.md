- My first video game! Made using unity and blender for android phones
- Endless runner style game featuring different enemies, powerups, achievements, upgrades and customizable backgrounds and main character models.
- Music by: Matt McFarland (www.mattmcfarland.com)
- Everything other than the music was done from scratch by me - this includes art, 3d models, programming etc

## How to play:

- Tilt your phone to move left or right. Your objective is to go as far up as possible avoiding rocks and enemy attacks.
- Slide your finger across the screen to attack. Slash enemy turrets to destroy them.
- Destroying enemies gives you gold to spend on upgrades and customizations. Sometimes enemies also drop special temporary powerups.
- Powerups include:
  - Shield: Makes you invulnerable to damage
  - Auto Shooter: Allows the spaceship to temporarily shoot missiles
  - Super slasher: Allows you to slash and destroy the normally indestructable rocks
  - Rampage: Ship speeds upwards and is temporarily invencible destroying everything it touches.
